    "🛠️ COMPILATION STEPS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CLEAN PREVIOUS BUILDS:\n",
    "   Remove any existing build artifacts:\n",
    "   - Delete 'build' directory\n",
    "   - Delete 'dist' directory  \n",
    "   - Delete '*.egg-info' directories\n",
    "   - Delete any '.pyd' or '.so' files in pandana/\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SET UP ENVIRONMENT (Windows with MSYS2):\n",
    "   Open MSYS2 terminal and run:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   export PATH=\"/mingw64/bin:$PATH\"\n",
    "   export CC=gcc\n",
    "   export CXX=g++\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install cython numpy pandas setuptools wheel\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. BUILD ENHANCED PANDANA:\n",
    "   Method A - Development build:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python setup.py build_ext --inplace\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Method B - Install build:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install -e .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Method C - Clean build:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python setup.py clean --all\n",
    "   python setup.py build_ext --inplace\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. VERIFY COMPILATION:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import pandana\n",
    "   from pandana import cyaccess\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Check enhanced methods\n",
    "   print(dir(cyaccess.cyaccess))\n",
    "   # Should include: hybrid_nodes_in_range, get_batch_aggregate_accessibility_variables\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required\":\n",
    "   - Install Visual Studio Build Tools 2019+\n",
    "   - Or use MSYS2 with MinGW-w64\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"long long vs long\" dtype errors:\n",
    "   - Ensure cyaccess.pyx uses 'long long' consistently\n",
    "   - Check that all arrays are properly typed\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"Cannot import cyaccess\":\n",
    "   - Check that .pyd file was created in pandana/\n",
    "   - Verify all dependencies are installed\n",
    "   - Try rebuilding with verbose output: --verbose\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"Contraction Hierarchies errors\":\n",
    "   - Ensure all CH source files are present in src/contraction_hierarchies/\n",
    "   - Check that paths in setup.py are correct\n",
    "\n",
    "🧪 TESTING COMPILATION:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. BASIC TEST:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import pandana as pdna\n",
    "   print(\"Pandana imported successfully\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ENHANCED METHODS TEST:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from pandana import cyaccess\n",
    "   methods = dir(cyaccess.cyaccess)\n",
    "   enhanced = [m for m in methods if m in ['hybrid_nodes_in_range', \n",
    "                                          'get_batch_aggregate_accessibility_variables']]\n",
    "   print(f\"Enhanced methods found: {enhanced}\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SIMPLE NETWORK TEST:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Create minimal network to test functionality\n",
    "   # (See test_network_creation function above)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "📊 PERFORMANCE COMPARISON SETUP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. COMPILE ORIGINAL PANDANA:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd pandana-dev-original/\n",
    "   pip install -e . --user\n",
    "   import pandana_original as pdna_orig\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. COMPILE ENHANCED PANDANA:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd pandana-dev/\n",
    "   pip install -e . --force-reinstall\n",
    "   import pandana as pdna_enhanced\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. RUN COMPARISON TESTS:\n",
    "   Use the performance testing framework in this notebook\n",
    "   \n",
    "💡 OPTIMIZATION TIPS:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For faster compilation:\n",
    "   - Use parallel builds: python setup.py build_ext --inplace -j4\n",
    "   - Enable compiler optimizations in setup.py\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For debugging:\n",
    "   - Add --debug flag to build commands\n",
    "   - Use --verbose for detailed output\n",
    "   - Check compiler warnings\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For production:\n",
    "   - Build with optimizations: -O3 or -O2\n",
    "   - Consider profile-guided optimization (PGO)\n",
    "\n",
    "🔄 ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After making changes to .pyx files:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python setup.py build_ext --inplace --force\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. After making changes to .cpp/.h files:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python setup.py clean --all\n",
    "   python setup.py build_ext --inplace\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For complete rebuild:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   rm -rf build/ dist/ *.egg-info/\n",
    "   find . -name \"*.pyd\" -delete\n",
    "   python setup.py build_ext --inplace\n",
